        "\n",
        "ANS. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are like blueprints that define the attributes (data) and methods (functions) associated with an object. OOP is designed to improve code reusability, scalability, and organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts of OOP:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to perform differently based on the object calling them.\n",

        "Think of a class like a blueprint for a house. The blueprint describes the structure (like rooms, doors, windows) but is not the actual house. Similarly, a class defines how an object should behave and what data it should hold, but the object itself is a real-world instance of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Components of a Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Attributes (Properties): These are variables that store information about the object. For example, in a Car class, attributes can be color, brand, and model.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The main purpose of inheritance is to promote code reusability and reduce redundancy. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, you can create a base class and reuse its functionalities in derived classes.\n",
